> Look , I\'m charging!

There are more than enough stories about batteries exploding due to
overcharging. Too much stress on a battery can lead to a chemical
reaction and boom! Your battery is history. With the DIY TP4056 Battery
Charging Module you won\'t need to worry about that happening because
this bad boy automatically shuts off once your battery is full.

The circuit is based on a highly efficient switching power supply
controlled with an output voltage of 5V and current up to 1000mA.

This project is designed to charge single cells Li-Ion/LiPo/LiFe with
protection against overcharge and short circuits, making it perfect for
DIY projects which require a reliable and safe charger.

As you can see in the pictures above the PCB is very well manufactured
and I've got the same PCB assembled with all the components that we want
to use for our main board and all the labels and logos are there to
guide me during the soldering steps. You can also download the Gerber
file for this circuit from the download link below in case you want to
place an order for the same circuit design.

**Step 2: Comparing Generic TP4056 With Our JLCPCB Designed TP4056.**


> The Generic TP4056 has Micro-Usb port while our designed TP4056 has
> Type-C port , which is more convinient to use.
>
> The Generic TP4056 comes in Blue Colour while we can order our custom
> designed PCB in many colours.

**Step 4: Powering the TP4056 Module and Checking the Output Voltage.**


> Connect the Type-C cable to TP4056 Module.
>
> Checking the input voltage which is around 5 volts.\
> Checking the output voltage which is around 4.3 volts.
>
> So now, we can consider that our module is working.
